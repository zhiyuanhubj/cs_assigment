For variables with too many categories (e.g. >30) to be suitable for one-hot encoding, a common alternative is [Target Encoding](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/targetencoder.html), which replaces each category with a numeric value (roughly, the average value of the target variable for that particular category).\n",

    "Assume you have a $d$-dimensional dataset `X` in the Euclidean space, i.e., each data point as $d$ numerical features (with each feature value in the interval $[0, 1]$). After running DBSCAN over `X`, you get some clustering (again, we only assume it's not only noise). Now you create a new dataset `X_new` by multiplying all data points by 10 afterwards adding 100 to all data points (in Python, assuming X is a NumPy array this can simply be done by `X_new = X * 10 + 100`). Now you can run DBSCAN over `X_new`.\n",
